# MMM-BetterHourly
MagicMirror Better hourly view that skips certain preconfigured hours.

The default hourly weather type doesn't have the ability to skip certain hours for example 12 to 6 at night. This module allows to set start and end time which are skipped in the hourly view. 

This modules uses Buienradar (The Netherlands and Belgium weather https://www.buienradar.nl/) for now, but you can create a PR if you want to support something else.
